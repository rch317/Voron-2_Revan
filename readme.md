# Voron 2.4r2 - Revan
## LDO Voron v2.4r2 (Rev.D) 300m kit

General assortment of how my V2 was built and modified. I'll add STL's to the repo once I get around to cleaning them up a bit. A lot of this stuff was hacked together to make it work for my needs. Likely, there's a better mod out there to do exactly what I had done... but I couldn't find them.
