# Voron 2.4r2 - Revan

General build log for my first Voron v2.4, that I have named Revan.  Most of this is being done well after
the fact, so I'm likely forgettings things. Mostly being done for my own peace of mind, but maybe it will
help someone else, who knows? Best part, I'll have a good place to store configs and such. So let's start
there. Want to build a Voron? If so; I would highly recommend you start a git repo and track your progress,
especially your `printer.cfg` (and other configs)

## The BOM
I had originally inteded to self-source, but quickly shifted into buying various kits. I started with a fastener
kit, and then a frame... then on an impulsive whim late one night,  I just bought an entire LDO Rev.D kit. 
` ¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

I purchased the kit from [KB3D](https://kb-3d.com/), and fortunately they are only about 4hrs from me. That means 1-2 day shipping, usually... Unless the USPS does the dumb. Which they have done the dumb twice now.

## The Build(tm)
Something I didn't do, that I kind of regret, was utilizing the main documentation site. I jumped right into the
assembly manual, and there we definitely "tips and tricks" that I initially missed. Start here, then move to the assembly.

## Mods
I've printed and tested a variety of mods, and quickly realized I wasn't doing a very good job of tracking them. This becomes a problem when you need to replace parts... So here we are, trying to keep track of them.

  - Nevermore Micro
    - https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro/tree/master/V6
      - A nice filtering system for the V2. The LDO kit ships with parts to build the V5_Duo, but everything fit for the V6, so that's what I ended up using.

  - PUG (Parametric Umbilical Gland)
    - https://www.printables.com/model/378567-pug-parametric-umbilical-gland
      - A great mod if you don't have the means to depin connectors on a cable to pass through a typical PG7 or similar gland.

  - Another toolhead umbilical for Voron 2.4
    - https://www.printables.com/model/411846-another-toolhead-umbilical-for-voron-24
      - Not sure I'm using this as-is yet.

  - No Z Chain for Voron 2.4
    - https://www.printables.com/model/712328-no-z-chain-for-voron-24
      - Not sure I'm using this as-is yet

  - CW2 Mounting Arm for PUG
    - https://www.printables.com/model/747487-clockwork-2-mounting-arm-for-pug-umbilical

  - Voron 2 Bed Stop Stopper Mount Guide Holder
    - https://www.printables.com/model/694247-voron-2-bed-stop-stopper-mount-guide-holder
      - I found this to be exceptionally useful, as even the roll-in t-nuts liked to move around on me from time to time, making re-aligning a bit of a pain. This also did a great job of holding the thumb screws in position as I mounted the plate.

  - SB Facelift
     - https://www.printables.com/model/789456-improved-stealthburner-faces-with-stripes-claws-an
     - I went with the hex pattern
